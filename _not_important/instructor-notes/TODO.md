### ModernJS tweaks

-[ ] All Modern JS exercises need to change. More instructions, so they can see the answers for what i'm doing? Let them do it on their own? Find a way to make it more hands-on for them, easier for them to get to the answers, and still not take a lot of time.

-[ ] In instructor notes for import/export, make sure I talk more about named vs default more!

-[ ] Modern JS #4 (async/await) is way too fast. Slow down, talk more about what you're doing.

-[ ] Many modern JS features can be removed from "big up-front" exercises! Object destructuring, array destructuring, implicit return can all be held back until they see code without them - and sprinkle them in when they come up (just mention them)! There are probably other features that could do the same!

## Quality

-[ ] Revisit all instructions. Add more detail & clarity.

-[ ] Inconsistent names of functions - make sure I **always** name functions in examples/solutions!

-[ ] Explain async stuff better

-[x] Ex 11 - take a look at FriendFlipper in completed/SOLUTIONS. Something might be wrong with it.

-[ ] At least one place has the wrong name of prevState/prevProps. Check them!

-[ ] test windows subsystem for linux

-[ ] test fish shell
