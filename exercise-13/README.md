# Exercise 13

## Modern JavaScript: Class Syntax

This exercise introduces you to the class syntax feature utilized in modern JavaScript applications.

The instructor will lead you through some code examples. Follow along!

### Setup

This exercise utilizes unit tests for demonstration purposes. You don't need to know much about unit tests coming in.

ðŸ‘‰ Start your test suite. Open a new command window at the root of this project, and enter `npm run test-exercise-13`.

You should see the following output:

```
No tests found related to files changed since last commit.
Press `a` to run all tests, or run Jest with `--watchAll`.

Watch Usage
 â€º Press a to run all tests.
 â€º Press p to filter by a filename regex pattern.
 â€º Press t to filter by a test name regex pattern.
 â€º Press q to quit watch mode.
 â€º Press Enter to trigger a test run.
```

If you don't see this output, try to investigate the message you see, ask your neighbor, or raise your hand for assistance.

If you do see this output, you're in good shape. The output will change as we modify our code.

### Follow Along

The instructor will help you rewrite unit tests using class syntax.

### Extra Credit

- Read about [prototypal inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain), and how it differs from classical inheritance.
