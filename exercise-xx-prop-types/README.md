# Exercise 9
## Defining PropTypes

PropTypes are a way to validate props passed into a component. If a propType is not met, you'll get a warning in your browser console. This is a nice way to make sure you're passing around the data your components need.

This exercise will introduce you to working with PropTypes. 

ðŸ‘‰ Start the app for Exercise 9

In a console window, pointed at the root of this project, run `npm run start-exercise-9`.

This should open a browser window pointed at localhost:3000, showing a web app titled "Exercise 9: Defining PropTypes", and our three adorable kitten friends. If it doesn't, ask your neighbor for assistance or raise your hand.

ðŸ‘‰ Open Exercise.js

All of your work for this exercise will take place in Exercise.js.

### Defining PropTypes

In this exercise, all of our components are stateless functional components. This means that we need to attach `propTypes` after the function is declared, like below:

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  return <div>...</div>;
}

MyComponent.propTypes = {
  fieldOne: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  fieldTwo: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
};
```

Any defined propType field can be marked as required by attaching `.isRequired` to the end of it, like the example above.

The `PropTypes` object (imported from the `prop-types` dependency) includes a handful of types. Following are a few.

* `array`
* `bool`
* `number`
* `string`
* `object`: Validates that the prop is any object
* `shape`: Validates that the prop is an object of a specified shape

ðŸ‘‰ Define `propTypes` for the `FriendProfile` component.

The props passed into the `FriendProfile` component are:

* `name`: this is a string, and it is required.
* `image`: this is a string, and it is required.

If you get stuck, [see a possible solution here](./SOLUTIONS.md#friendprofile-proptypes).

ðŸ‘‰ Define `propTypes` for the `Friends` component.

The props passed into the `Friends` component are:

* `friends`: this is an array, and it is required.

If you get stuck, [see a possible solution here](./SOLUTIONS.md#friends-array).

### Specifying the shape of an array

When we define a propType of type array, we can also specify the shape of items in the array. Following is an example of a component that requires an array named `people`. Each element of the `people` array must contain two properties: `firstName` and `lastName`.

```jsx
MyComponent.propTypes = {
  people: PropTypes.arrayOf(
    PropTypes.shape({
      firstName: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
      lastName: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    })
  )
}
```
ðŸ‘‰ Specify the shape of elements required in the `friends` array passed into the `Friends` component, using `PropTypes.arrayOf` and `PropTypes.shape`.

If you get stuck, [see a possible solution here](./SOLUTIONS.md#friends-arrayof-shape).

ðŸ‘‰ Remove a required property from the `myFriends` array.

You choose which one. After removing the property, check your browser console to see what happens when a required prop isn't passed into a component.

You should see an error like this: 

```
index.js:2178 Warning: Failed prop type: The prop `image` is marked as required in `FriendProfile`, but its value is `undefined`.
```

If you get stuck, [see a possible solution here](./SOLUTIONS.md#removed-property).
