# Exercise 6

## What can a component render?

React function components are limited in what they can return. This exercise will introduce you to the 5 most frequently returned kinds of results.

ðŸ‘‰ Start the app for Exercise 6

In a console window, pointed at the root of this project, run `npm run start-exercise-6`.

This should open a browser window pointed at localhost:3000, showing a web app titled "Exercise 6: What can a component render?". If it doesn't, ask your neighbor for assistance or raise your hand.

ðŸ‘‰ Open Exercise.js

All of your work for this exercise will take place in Exercise.js.

The return value of a React function component is what gets rendered to the DOM. Throughout this exercise, we'll use the terms "render" and "return" interchangeably.

### Elements/React Components

Most frequently, a component will render either an HTML element, or another React component.

Currently, the `Friends` component is returning an HTML element - a single `<div>`. Most of the examples we've seen so far have returned HTML elements.

There is a second component in `Exercise.js` - the `FriendProfile` component.

ðŸ‘‰ Modify the `Friends` component to return a single `<FriendProfile>` element. Pass the name of the first item in the `myFriends` array as a prop to the `<FriendProfile>`.

Check your browser to see if you succeeded! You should see the name `Potatoes` rendered.

If you get stuck, [see a possible solution here](./SOLUTIONS.md#react-components).

ðŸ‘‰ "Inspect element" in your browser, and look for the elements rendered by the `<FriendProfile>` component.

You should see that the component is rendered as a div with text content.

### Fragments

Valid JSX requires a single top-level element (similar to how valid XML requires a single top-level element). To demonstrate this, we're going to break our app.

ðŸ‘‰ Modify the `Friends` component to return an `<h1>` element adjacent to the `<FriendProfile>` element.

You should see an error in your browser, similar to this:

```
./exercise-6/Exercise.js
  Line 4:  Parsing error: Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag. Did you want a JSX fragment <>...</>?

  2 |
  3 | export default function Friends() {
> 4 |   return <h1>hello, friends!</h1><FriendProfile name={myFriends[0].name} />;
    |                                  ^
  5 | }
  6 |
  7 | function FriendProfile(props) {
```

As the error indicates, this is invalid syntax.

We can fix this a couple ways.

#### Wrapping in a `<div>`

ðŸ‘‰ Modify the `Friends` component so that the `<h1>` and `<FriendProfile>` elements are wrapped in a `<div>` element.

Check your browser to see if you succeeded! You should see your title emitted, along with the name `Potatoes`.

If you get stuck, [see a possible solution here](./SOLUTIONS.md#wrapping-in-a-div).

ðŸ‘‰ "Inspect element" in your browser, and find the elements rendered by the `<Friends>` component.

You'll see that your components are wrapped in a `<div>` - the one you used to wrap the `<h1>` and `<FriendProfile>` elements.

This solves the problem...but it adds elements to the DOM that we don't really need. One element might not seem like a big deal, but in a large React app, we can end up with significant DOM pollution from this practice.

React v16 introduced a way to solve this problem - the `Fragment`.

#### Wrapping in a `<Fragment>`

The `Fragment` component is basically an empty wrapper. It allows us to provide a single top-level element when we are rendering multiple child elements, but it does not actually render anything to the DOM.

You can access the `Fragment` component on the default `React` import (i.e. `React.Fragment`).

ðŸ‘‰ Replace the wrapping `<div>` element in the `Friends` component with a wrapping `<React.Fragment>` element.

Check your browser to see if you succeeded! You should still see all friends listed.

If you get stuck, [see a possible solution here](./SOLUTIONS.md#wrapping-in-a-fragment).

ðŸ‘‰ "Inspect element" in your browser, and find the elements rendered by the `<Friends>` component.

You should see that there's no longer an unnecessary div wrapping your output.

### Arrays

Sometimes you want to turn an array of data into an array of elements. This can be accomplished with `Array.map`, as we saw in the JSX Fundamentals exercise.

ðŸ‘‰ Modify the `Friends` component to return one `<FriendProfile>` element for each item in the `myFriends` array. For each item, pass the `name` and `age` as props to the `<FriendProfile>`.

Don't forget that React wants you to use a `key` prop when you render an array of items!

Check your browser to see if you succeeded! You should see each of the friends listed.

If you get stuck, [see a possible solution here](./SOLUTIONS.md#arrays).

ðŸ‘‰ "Inspect element" in your browser, and find the elements rendered by the `<Friends>` component.

You should see a `<div>` for each friend.

### Strings/Numbers

Sometimes you want a component to render nothing more than a string or number. When a React function component returns a string or number, it gets rendered as a text node in the DOM.

ðŸ‘‰ Modify the `FriendProfile` component to return only the `name` prop.

Check your browser to see if you succeeded! You should see each of the friends listed, abutted against each other.

If you get stuck, [see a possible solution here](./SOLUTIONS.md#strings-or-numbers).

ðŸ‘‰ "Inspect element" in your browser, and find the elements rendered by the `<Friends>` component.

You will see that the friend names are rendered as text nodes, all within the same `<div>`.

### null

Sometimes we don't want a component to render anything at all. This is usually true when we are using conditional logic to render different results based on inputs.

When the value `null` is returned from a component, nothing gets rendered to the DOM.

ðŸ‘‰ Modify the `FriendProfile` component to return `null` if the `age` prop is undefined; otherwise return the value of the `name` prop.

Check your browser to see if you succeeded! You should see two of the friends listed - Potatoes and Flower.

If you get stuck, [see a possible solution here](./SOLUTIONS.md#null).
