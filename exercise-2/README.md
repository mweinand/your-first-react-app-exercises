# Exercise 2

## Identifying Components

You've been given handouts by the instructor. In this exercise, you'll use a pen to mark up these handouts.

One of the most important skills to successful React development is the ability to identify and isolate components. Draw boxes on the handouts you've been given, identifying the boundaries of components.

Remember that components are made of more components. Break large components down into smaller components. Find the seams based on responsibility.
